// Package cdtype defines main types and constants for Cairo-Dock applets.
/*

External applets are small programs spawned by the dock to manage dedicated icons.
Once started, the program can use his icon to display informations and receive
user interactions like mouse events and keyboard shortcuts.

This API now covers all the dock external features, so it shouldn't change much.
All the base actions and callbacks are provided by Cairo-Dock, and are in stable
state, so everything provided will remain in almost the same format.
Only the name, args, of way to access some methods may evolve in the Golang
implementation, but only to better suits the needs and provide a great
Cairo-Dock Golang API.
Those changes could be made to fix some issues you may encounter while using it,
so feel free to test it and post your comments on the forum.


Applet lifecycle

The applet loading is handled by the dock, then it's up the applet to act upon
events received to work as expected and quit when needed. Be aware that you
don't control your applet, the dock does. Most of your work is to connect events
and make them useful.
The default Reload event will launch an Init call with the given loadConfig value
and restart the poller if any (can be overriden).

	Applet is created and started by the dock when its icon is enabled.
	  DefineEvents().
	  connect to backend.
	  Init(loadConfigTrue)
	  start poller with instant check (if any).
	Applet is alive
	  can act on icon to display informations.
	  receives and answers to connected events.
	  event reload will trigger other Init event with or without loadConfig.
	  regular poller ticking (if any).
	Applet receives event quit when the icon is removed or the dock closed.
	  triggers applet End event before releasing the main loop.


Applet sources

Sources for the applet will better be separated from applet data, for easier
maintenance. So we will start by creating 2 directories.
You can use a src subdir to keep them grouped.
In this example we will use demo and demo/src.

The applet management file will be demo/src/demo.go


Applet creation

First, we need to declare and create our applet. For this we will extend a
CDApplet object and declare our config struct (see later for the config).
As this will only be called once, this is the place to declare all your permanent
data that will be required during all the applet lifetime.

	package demo

	import (
		"github.com/sqp/godock/libs/cdtype" // Dock types.
		"github.com/sqp/godock/libs/dock"   // Applet base.
	)

	// Applet data and controlers.
	//
	type Applet struct {
		cdtype.AppBase // Extends applet base and dock connection.

		conf *appletConf // applet configuration data.
	}

	// NewApplet creates a new applet instance.
	//
	func NewApplet() cdtype.AppBase {
		app := &Applet{AppBase: dock.NewCDApplet()} // Icon controler and interface to cairo-dock.
		// Create and set your permanent items here...
		return app
	}


Applet init

Then we will have to declare the mandatory Init(loadConf bool) method:

Init is called at startup and every time the applet is asked to reload by the dock.
First, it reload the config file if asked to, and then it should (re)initialise
everything needed. Don't forget that you may have to clean some things up.
SetDefaults will help you as it reset everything it handles, even if not set
(default blank value is used).

	// Load user configuration if needed and initialise applet.
	//
	func (app *Applet) Init(loadConf bool) {
		app.LoadConfig(loadConf, &app.conf) // Load config will crash if fail. Expected.

		// Set defaults to dock icon: display and controls.
		app.SetDefaults(cdtype.Defaults{
			Label: app.conf.Name,
			Icon: app.conf.Icon,
			Commands: cdtype.Commands{
				0:   cdtype.NewCommandStd(app.conf.LeftAction, app.conf.LeftCommand, app.conf.LeftClass),
				1: cdtype.NewCommandStd(app.conf.MiddleAction, app.conf.MiddleCommand)},
			Debug: app.conf.Debug,
		})
	}

Applet events

DefineEvents is called by the backend only once at startup.
Its goal is to get a common place for events callback configuration.
The same events can also be declared directly as methods of your applet
(actually, both would be called, but its not sure this will remain. we'll see
what are the needs).
See cdtype.Events for the full list with arguments.


	// Define applet events callbacks.
	//
	func (app *Applet) DefineEvents(events cdtype.Events) {
		// To forward click events to the defined command launcher.
		// It would be better to use consts instead of 0 and 1 like in this example.

		events.OnClick       = app.Command().CallbackInt(0)
		events.OnMiddleClick = app.Command().CallbackNoArg(1)

		events.OnDropData = func(data string) { // For simple callbacks event, use a closure.
			app.Log().Info("dropped", data)
		}

		events.OnBuildMenu = func(menu cdtype.Menuer) {
			menu.AddEntry("disabled entry", "", nil)
			menu.AddSeparator()
			menu.AddEntry("my action", "system-run", func() {app.Log().Info("clicked") })
		}
	}

Define events is now optional as you can also provide your events callbacks as
methods of your applet, with the same name and arguments.
There is no way to document it directly, and no safety check at compilation, as
the hook service just use matching methods.

	func (app *Applet) DefineEvents(events cdtype.Events) {
		events.OnDropData = func(data string) { // For simple callbacks event, use a closure.
			app.Log().Info("dropped", data)
		}
	}

	// can become

	func (app *Applet) OnDropData(data string) {
			app.Log().Info("dropped", data)
	}

Note that both methods are available and enabled at the same time, and you may
be able to use them both in the same applet, but this isn't really tested.


Poller

The applet main loop can handle a polling service to help you update data on a
regular basis. The poller will be agnostic of what's happening, he will just
trigger the provided call at the end of timer or in case of manual reset with
app.Poller().Restart().

Create your poller with the applet.
	func NewApplet() cdtype.AppBase {
		// ...
		app.service = NewService(app)    // This will depend on your applet polling service.
		app.Poller().Add(app.service.Check) // Create poller and set action callback.
		// ...
	}

Set interval in Init when you have config values.
	app.Poller().SetInterval(app.conf.UpdateInterval)
or
	app.SetDefaults(cdtype.Defaults{
		// ...
		PollerInterval: app.conf.UpdateInterval,
		// ...
		})


Config

The configuration loading can be fully handled by LoadConfig if the config
struct is created accordingly.

Main conf struct: one nested struct for each config page with its name refered
to in the "group" tag.

Sub conf structs: one field for each setting you need with the keys and types
refering to those in your .conf file loaded by the dock. As fields are filled by
reflection, they must be public and start with an uppercase letter.

If the name of you field is the same as in the config file, just declare it.

If you have different names, or need to refer to a lowercase field in the file,
you must add a "conf" tag with the name of the field to match in the file.

The applet configuration file will be demo/src/config.go

	type appletConf struct {
		groupIcon                       `group:"Icon"`
		groupConfiguration              `group:"Configuration"`
	}

	type groupIcon struct {
		Name             string         `conf:"name"`
		Icon             string         `conf:"icon"`
	}

	type groupConfiguration struct {
		GaugeName        string
		UpdateInterval   int
		Devices          []string
	}

The matching configuration file will better be created by copying an existing
applet config, and adapting it to your needs.

Applet data files

Files needed in the "demo" directory:
   demo            the executable binary or script, without extension (use the shebang on the first line).
   demo.conf       the default config file (see above for the options syntax).
   auto-load.conf  the file describing our applet.
   applet.go       source to load and start the applet as standalone.

Files optional in the "demo" directory:
   icon            the default icon of the applet (without extension, can be any image format).
   preview         an image preview of the applet (without extension, can be any image format).
   Makefile        shortcuts to build and link the applet.

auto-load.conf
	[Register]

	# Author of the applet
	author = AuthorName

	# A short description of the applet and how to use it.
	description = This is the description of the applet.\nIt can be on several lines.

	# Category of the applet : 2 = files, 3 = internet, 4 = Desktop, 5 = accessory, 6 = system, 7 = fun
	category = 5

	# Version of the applet; change it everytime you change something in the config file. Don't forget to update the version both in this file and in the config file.
	version = 0.0.1

	# Default icon to use if no icon has been defined by the user. If not specified, or if the file is not found, the "icon" file will be used.
	icon =

	# Whether the applet will act as a launcher or not (like Pidgin or Transmission)
	act as launcher = false

applet.go
	package main

	import (
		demo "demo/src"                     // Package with your applet source.
		"github.com/sqp/godock/libs/dock"   // Connection to cairo-dock.
	)

	func main() {
		dock.StartApplet(demo.NewApplet())
	}

Makefile
	TARGET=demo
	SOURCE=github.com/sqp/godock/applets

	# Default is standard build for current arch.

	%: build

	build:
		go build -o $(TARGET) $(SOURCE)/$(TARGET)

	# make a link to the user external directory for easy install.
	link:
		ln -s $(GOPATH)/src/$(SOURCE)/$(TARGET) $(HOME)/.config/cairo-dock/third-party/$(TARGET)


Register applet in the dock

To register our "demo" applet in the dock, we have to link it as "demo" in the external applets dir.
 ~/.config/cairo-dock/third-party/demo

 This can be done easily once you have configured the SOURCE location in the
 Makefile with the "make link" command.

or use the external system directory

  /usr/share/cairo-dock/plug-ins/Dbus/third-party/

Notes

A lot more tips are to be found for each method, but here are a few to help you
start:
 *The dock will launch the applet command (applet binary or script) with
   a few options to help it know some dock settings. Those args will only be
   parsed and stored in the public fields during StartApplet, so they won't be
   available at applet creation (Name, FileLocation, FileDataDir...).
   You can only start using them in the first Init call. Only the logger is safe
   to use before that.
 *The current directory by default is the applet directory, but to be safe don't
   rely on it and use chdir or absolute paths for all your file operations.
 *If you want to publish the package or ask for help, it would be easier if the
   applet is located in a "go gettable" directory (just use the same location in
   GOPATH as you have in your public repo, like this API).
 *Applets, once stable, can be packed in an applet manager, currently handled by
   the cdc command. To forward the applet start to the cdc loader, create a tocdc
   file and link it to the applet name (ln -s tocdc demo).
   You will just have to remove the link and rebuild the binary to switch back
   to a single instance mode. Or delete the binary and relink to reuse the loader.

	tocdc:
		#!/bin/sh
		cdc service $* "$(pwd)" &
