/*
Update and build your dock from sources with this applet for the Cairo-Dock project.

Install go and get go environment: you need a valid $GOPATH var and directory.

Download, build and install to your Cairo-Dock external applets dir:
  go get -d github.com/sqp/godock/applets/Update  # download applet and dependencies.

  cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/sqp/godock/applets/Update
  make        # compile the applet.
  make link   # link the applet to your external applet directory.



TODO: Version checking:
  get a better bzr result than simple revno if the user is on a different branch
   with an other stack of patches. (need to get the split version to know the real number of missing patches)
